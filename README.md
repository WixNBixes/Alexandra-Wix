# Portfolio for Alex Wix

## About me

I am a young, enthusiastic and ambitious woman who wants to involve herself in software development. I learned to code initially at college and after I achieved my A levels, I didn't really return to it until lockdown started in 2020. Since then, I've been working hard in my spare time honing my skills and achieving accreditations in C# and Python as well as completing courses on Java.

### Short Term Goals

For 2021, I want to achieve two certifications in Java (OCA: Java SE8 Programmer IZ0-808 and OCP Java SE8 Programmer II). I also want to create a program in Python and Java to put on GitHub and update them to a reasonable standard. I would also want to learn how to code and use Unity engine so I can experiment with game development.

Before the end of the year I would like the opportunity to prove myself professionally in a software development environment. As someone who finds satisfaction in solving problems creatively and wants the chance to develop projects from the ground up, it would be an amazing achievement for me if I could involve myself in such a vibrant, growing and challenging industry.

### Long Term Goals

I want to learn more languages and eventually get to the point where I can start to improve myself in a way that would involve QA testing. I'm currently a network maintenance engineer, which means I tend to use my skills to solve problems on customer sites to bring them back online. I'm very good at fault finding because I understand how networks operate and can easily narrow down what the problem might be even before I arrive at site. I want to one day apply this to software development and combine them.

I am also trying to develop myself in a way where I can feel comfortable and confident enough to lead projects and a team to complete them within a deadline. This is something I feel I can't do in my current workspace, as there are individuals who aren't willing to work within a team or be part of one. I would want to share my passion with others, inspire and encourage them to develop the project the best way it can rather than harass them until it's done.
